        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a first generation academic from the UK currently living and working in the USA. I had know from a young age that a university education was something
          I wanted and an early interest in science at school led me to an undergraduate degree in Microbiology followed by a master's degree and a Phd in Medical
          Microbiology.<br>
          My interest in biology as a child stemmed from a (common) childhood dream of growing up to be a veterinarian; my interest in microbiology came later,
          inspired by a university open day lecture that introduced me to bacteriophages. Microbiology captured my imagination; entire ecosystems at a scale invisible 
          to the human eye that allow us to observe the unyielding forces of evolution in real-time.<br>
          My research for the last seven years has been focused on the opportunistic pathogen, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. I have studied this bacterium in three 
          different disease systems (bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis (CF), and ocular keratitis) and have focused largely on the genomic and regulatory changes that 
          allow this versatile organism to cause disease in almost any part of the body. I have now broadened my focus to investigate the organisms with which <i>P. 
          aeruginosa</i> shares its niche in the airways of people with CF.<br>
          My current research in the <a href="http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/lab/bomberger-lab" target="_blank"><u>Bomberger</u></a> and <a href="http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/lab/cooper-lab" target="_blank">
          <u>Cooper</u></a> labs at the <a href="http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a> seeks to uncover the changes in the microbiome of the upper and lower 
          respiratory tracts of CF patients that occur during acute viral infection. This project aims to shed more light on how changes in host immune response and 
          nutrient availability during these viral infections can lead to increased morbidity and mortality in CF patients over time.</p>
